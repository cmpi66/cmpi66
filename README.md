# Hi, I'm [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-munoz-88052b207), an IT and Cybersecurity Professional

Security-focused practitioner with a background in IT infrastructure, Linux hardening, and detection engineering. This GitHub documents hands-on security projects, many of which started from trusted guides or community tutorials â€” then evolved through real implementation, testing, and debugging. Everything here reflects working systems I've built, broken, and refined in my own environment.

Tools include: YubiKey (OpenPGP/SSH), Dracut, Ansible, rclone, and Microsoft Sentinel.
